Here is our game!

To play: please see the root folder. It will have .7z file called WindowsGameBuild. Unity and github do not work well with each other (as I unfortunately learned), so trying to pull and build from Unity would not work well. Please unzip this file and run MountainMadness2024.exe.
The game is simple: you are trying to help direct a plasma ball from one robot to another. This is to be done with a pair of refractive mirror cubes: if a ball hits a mirror, it will switch directions 90 degrees depending on the rotation of the cube. Click and drag to move your cubes around the grid, but beware - there are also dummy cubes there to confuse you. Right click on a cube to rotate (and change the redirection direction.)
Switching camera perspective is done with "q", for a view of the whole playing field (and the other robot's location.) However, be warned that in alternative view, your mouse controls disappear until you switch back.
Enjoy!
